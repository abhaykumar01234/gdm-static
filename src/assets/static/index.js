When a buyer first lands on your landing page, you want to quickly confirm they're in the right place and entice them to continue to scroll down the page. To do this, the heading of your page needs to include a strong value proposition, explaining how your product is unique from its competitors and explain the characteristics of your ideal customer or target market. Also, use a subheading to further personalize your value prop, including clear details about your target market, such as "perfect for companies with less than twenty-four users." This helps ensure buyers whether or not they are a good fit for your product.`,

Direct buyers to convert into a lead by including a call to action in a short online form, we find that action-oriented CTAs, such as "free trial" or "free demo" tend to convert at the highest rate. If a buyer knows exactly what will happen after they complete a form, they're more likely to provide their contact details.

This typically includes name, phone number, email, address, and maybe a qualifying field, such as the number of users or job title. The shorter the form, the more leads you're likely to generate. If your sales team does need more information, however, we recommend creating a two-part form, which collects essential personal information from a buyer in the first step and further qualifies the lead in the second step. That way, if a buyer drops off in the second step, your sales team still has the personal information from the first step and is able to follow up.
