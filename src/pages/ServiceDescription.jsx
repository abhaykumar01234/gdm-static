        to grant access to their account.
      </p>
      <h3>Payment</h3>
      <p>
        Customer shall be responsible for all fees resulting from the bids set
        and the resulting click activity received from the time a campaign is
        started until the campaign is turned off and shall pay all fees in
        accordance with the payment terms hereunder, unless otherwise agreed
        with us in the applicable IO. Payment must be in U.S. Dollars or in such
        other currency as agreed to in writing by the parties. Late payments
        bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate
        permitted by law, if less). Fees are exclusive of taxes. Customer is
        responsible for paying all taxes, government fees, and reasonable
        expenses and attorneys fees that we incur collecting late amounts. All
        former delinquent fees must be paid before a new campaign may begin. To
        the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all claims relating
        to fees (including without limitation any claims for fees based on
        suspected invalid clicks) unless claimed within 90 days after the charge
        (this does not affect Customer's credit card issuer rights). Fees are
        solely based on our measurements for the applicable Program, unless
        otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
        refunds (if any) are at our discretion. Nothing in these Terms or an IO
        may obligate us to extend credit to any party. Customer acknowledges and
        agrees that any credit card and related billing and payment information
        that Customer provides to us may be shared by us with companies who work
        on our behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely
        for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to us and
        servicing Customer's account. Billing and payment information provided
        by Customer to us may be used to satisfy delinquent fees. It is Vendor’s
        responsibility to maintain updated Credit Card information in the Vendor
        Portal or alert us immediately if Vendor no longer authorizes us to
        initiate charges to the Credit Card provided.
      </p>
      <h3>Program Participation</h3>
      <p>
        We own the content related to Product Listings. Customer is responsible
        for all content it contributes to the Product Listings. Customer is
        solely responsible for content on their own website Landing Pages. We
        are not responsible for anything related to Customer’s landing page on
        its own website and shall not be obligated to provide notice to Customer
        in the event that Customer’s website is not being displayed properly to
        end users. Customer shall protect any Customer passwords and takes full
        responsibility for Customer's own, and third party, use of any Customer
        accounts. Customer understands and agrees that listings may be placed on
        any content or property provided by us, and any other content or
        property provided by a third party upon which we place ads. Customer
        authorizes and consents to all such placements.
      </p>
      <h3>Conversion Tracking</h3>
      <p>
        You can Enroll in Conversion Tracking from the Conversion Tracking page
        under the Settings tab in your Vendor Portal. Conversion reporting will
        begin after the code has been installed on Your website and you’ve
        enrolled. Conversions will be reported on your Click Report within the
        Vendor Portal. The timeframe for a Conversion is 30 days from the day of
        the Click. Reports of Conversions are based on our definition of a
        Click. In rare cases, accuracy of Conversion Reporting may be affected
        by downtime of our servers. You are solely responsible for the viability
        of all links to Your website and proper installation of the conversion
        tracking code snippet to ensure accurate conversion reporting. We are
        not responsible for anything related to Your website. Should You change
        Your website at any time, You must insure that the code snippet remains
        installed correctly to ensure accurate conversion reporting. To stop
        conversion tracking, simply remove the conversion tracking snippet from
        Your website at any time. Conversion Tracking reporting through the
        Vendor Portal Click Report will cease when the code snippet is removed.
      </p>
      <h3>Termination</h3>
      <p>
        Customer reserves the right to cancel the Service at any time without
        penalty. Notice of cancellation must be made by email, include a reason
        for cancellation, and must be confirmed by us by email. Cancellation
        will occur within two business days of receipt of cancellation email.
        Digital Markets also reserves the right to cancel the Service at any
        time without penalty. Notice of cancellation will be confirmed by email
        and include a reason for cancellation. All click activity up until
        cancellation is the responsibility of the Customer. Any outstanding fees
        are due immediately upon cancellation. If any outstanding fees are left
        unpaid, Customer agrees to pay the collections fees incurred through our
        attempts to collect on the account.
      </p>
      <h3>Refunds and Credits</h3>
      <p>
        Claims of invalid clicks are considered on a case-by-case basis. To make
        a claim, email your account manager describing the click activity (dates
        of the traffic in question, etc.) with supporting data from your logs.
        All disputes must be made within 90 days of the invoice date.
