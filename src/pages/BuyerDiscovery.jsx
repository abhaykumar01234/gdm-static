      <h3>Know who’s researching your software</h3>
      <p>
        Companies searching for software tend to stay anonymous for as long as
        possible, which leaves software brands with very little time to engage
        the buying committee and influence purchase decisions. Buyer DiscoveryⓇ
        applies predictive modeling to identify companies with intent to
        purchase your software, or software like yours, so you can improve
        campaign performance and break into deals that would have flown under
        your radar.
