      <h1>Reviews Guidelines & Verification Process</h1>
      <p>
        Reviews help you build a strong online profile and showcase product
        feedback to help buyers make informed decisions during the software
        purchasing process.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a user-driven reviews platform, our sites act as a neutral service
        provider for discussion between software providers and buyers. We
        uphold&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.capterra.com/reviews/guidelines">
          reviews guidelines
        </a>
        &nbsp; for all users and each review undergoes a robust verification
        (Quality Assurance) process.
      </p>
      <h2>The Review Verification Process</h2>
      <p>
        Each review submitted to Gartner Digital Markets is manually checked by
        our team of experts to ensure published reviews are from trustworthy
        sources and provide helpful content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an overview of the three quality checks required for any review
        to be published:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Identity Check</strong>: Each reviewer is researched by our
          team of experts to find key identifiers such as name, job title, or
          email address to ensure that the review was left by a real person.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conflict of Interest Check</strong>: Each reviewer’s name and
          company is checked against the product they are reviewing to ensure
          they are not affiliated with the company or identified as a direct
          competitor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content Check</strong>: Each review undergoes an evaluation to
          ensure it is original, authentic, appropriate, and meets our review
          guidelines.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Respond to Reviews</h2>
      <p>
        Regardless of the review content, we recommend providing a clear,
        concise, and professional <a href="/vp/reviews">review response</a> in
        the vendor portal. Simply view your review, and you will be directed to
        a review response form.
      </p>
      <p>
        The business response will be published alongside the review to address
        the content shared by the reviewer. There is also the ability to opt to
        send the response directly to the reviewer to acknowledge their
        feedback.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Flag a Review</h2>
      <p>
        If you believe that a published review may be in violation of our
        guidelines, you are able to <a href="/vp/reviews">flag the review</a> to
        our Quality Assurance (QA) team from within your portal by following
        these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Visit your Reviews tab</li>
        <li>Click to view the review</li>
        <li>Complete the “Flag Review” box</li>
        <li>Submit your request</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Note that all reviews are treated equally during the verification
        process. We cannot modify or remove an opinion or statement from a valid
        reviewer, and that a request will only&nbsp;
        <strong>ensure an investigation</strong> from our team, not guarantee a
        removal.
