      <p>
        These Guidelines for Product Listings (“Guidelines”), which are
        incorporated by this reference into the General Vendor Terms, govern the
        use of our Sites, Services and Content by Gartner Digital Markets and
        its Affiliates and all Vendors, both Basic and Upgraded (“Vendors”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Product Listings are high-level descriptions of Vendor’s products
        (including vendor name & logo, product name & description, screenshots)
        created by Us or Vendor and featured in Gartner Digital Markets and our
        Affiliates (“Our”) online software categories (“categories”).

      <h2>Product Listing Creation:</h2>
      <p>
        In order to be a comprehensive resource for software buyers, we include
        all software product listings that are currently marketed or sold and
        fit in a category. To provide the most helpful software-buyer
        experience, our Catalog team will determine whether a product is a
        logical fit for a category through research on the vendor’s website.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will either create these listings from publicly available information
        or work with the software vendor to create and/or update a listing that
        is accurate and best reflects the product’s features.
      </p>
      <h2>Criteria for Posting Product Listings on our Sites:</h2>
      <p>
        Our aim is to list all B2B software solutions that fit within one or
        more of our categories. Among the criteria for inclusion are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is B2B software – we do not list exclusively B2C products,
          marketplaces or database websites, personal productivity solutions,
          product clones and/or personal apps.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is a packaged (pre-built / off-the-shelf) solution – we do not list
          custom-made/bespoke software.
        </li>

        <li>
          It must fit, at Our sole discretion, within one of the existing
          categories.
        </li>
        <li>It must be publicly available and out of Beta testing.</li>
        <li>
          It must be listed under the product name determined by the vendor - we
          do not list reseller names, integrators, consultants, or other third
          parties — unless the vendor expressly authorizes a reseller to list
          the product on their behalf.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding, we allow authorized resellers to participate in our
        lead generation programs. However, when the parent company requests lead
        generation for their product, the parent company will take precedence
        and the reseller will be disabled.
      </p>
      <h2>Product Listing Removal:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>At Vendor Request:</strong> In keeping with our goal to be a
        comprehensive resource for software buyers, we will not remove software
        product listings that are currently marketed or sold and fit in a
        category. We will work with the software vendor to update the listing to
        ensure it is accurate and best reflects the product’s features.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a software vendor is no longer in business and/or the product listed
        is no longer being sold (clearly reflected on the company website), we
        will either (i) review and remove the product listing from the catalog;
        or (ii) keep the listing and indicate that the product is no longer sold
        or discontinued.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>At Our Discretion:</strong> We reserve the right to modify or
        remove a Product Listing and/or Product Profile if, in our sole
        discretion, the listing or profile fails to comply with these
        Guidelines. As a rule, we do not remove Vendor Product Listings or
        Product Profiles unless: (i) the Product Listing or Profile does not fit
        within at least one of the existing software categories; or (ii) there
        is evidence to demonstrate that the Vendor’s product is no longer
        actively being marketed and/or sold to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        If through the course of ongoing maintenance and review of our catalog,
        we discover that an existing product listing no longer fits in a
        category and/or is not a legitimate, packaged B2B software product, it
        will be reviewed and removed.
      </p>
