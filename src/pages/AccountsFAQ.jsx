      <h3>How does the Pay Per Click program work?</h3>
      <p>
        Pay Per Click (PPC) listings display an overview of your solution in the
        software categories of your choice. Your listing includes links to your
        website so buyers can click through to learn more about your solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The success of a PPC campaign can be measured by tracking clicks that
        convert to leads on your website. We offer a free conversion tracking
        tool, as well as free lead tracking tutorials and website reviews for
        all of our customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no signup fees and there is no time commitment. All programs
        are pay-as-you-go.
      </p>
      <h3>Will I be charged for duplicate or invalid clicks?</h3>
      <p>
        You will not be charged for duplicate clicks from the same user during a
        single user session. Additionally, we have algorithms in place to
        prevent you from being charged for invalid clicks.
      </p>
      <h3>How do I manage my listing?</h3>
      <p>
        You can access and edit your&nbsp;
        <a href="/vp/products">product description</a>, product features
        information and URLs in your Gartner Digital Markets vendor portal. Your
        portal also includes a <a href="/vp/clicks">click report</a>, lead
        queues, and <a href="/vp/invoices">billing information</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>How does billing work?</h3>
      <p>
        We will bill your credit card at the beginning of each month for your
        clicks from the previous month.
      </p>
      <h3>Can I set a limit on my account?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, limits are tracked monthly. If you reach your account limit within
        the month, your listing will revert to the basic level for the remainder
        of the month. Listings that have hit their limit are automatically
        re-enabled at the beginning of the next month.
      </p>
      <h3>How do software buyers find our sites?</h3>
      <p>
        The Gartner Digital Markets network of sites — Capterra, GetApp and
        Software Advice — reach buyers wherever they are performing research: on
        the Internet using search engines and other websites, as well as at
        industry events and through relevant media outlets.
      </p>
      <h3>How do I cancel my account?</h3>
      <p>
        In order to suspend or cancel your account, contact your Account Rep.
      </p>
      <h3>How does Gartner Digital Markets use my contact information?</h3>
      <p>
        We adhere to Gartner's strict&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/about/policies/privacy">
          privacy policy
        </a>
        &nbsp; to prevent the misuse of your contact information.
